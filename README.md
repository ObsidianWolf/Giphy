# Giphy
# A dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 

## Why is this important?
For building connections in your community or workplace.
Pictures can say alot, but moving pictures say more. Express yourself 
whether its sarcastic, moving, or halarious, say more with less.


## What does it do?
Sends a request to a server to display what you asked for in the form of a GIF. 
Whether you decide to search animals, cartoons, people, movies, 
memes, or everything in between. In addition anything you search gets saved as 
a button so you don't have to re-type anything you have searched before.

## How to get started?
Download the Giphy folder GitHub. Once the folder is downloaded, 
double click the file titled index.html (this will open in your internet browser) 
to begin. Now just enter what you want to see.

## Technologies used?
HTML5, CSS, Java-Script, Jquery, Giphy API, Ajax.
